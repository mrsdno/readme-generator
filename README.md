  ## Description

  This is an application that can be used to create a professional README.md file for your project.

  In fact - I used the application to create this README.md file you are reading now! 
  
  It was made using NODE.js by Christine Diienno.

  ## Installation

  Clone this file to your computer, and then initialize the packages used for the application using `npm install` in the terminal.

  ## Usage
  
  Initailize the appropiate javascript file using `node index` in the terminal.

  The command line will then prompt a series of questions to help you create a professional README.md file. Answer the questions as they pertain to your application.

  Once the prompts are complete, a README.md file will be created with the information you provided in the **/dist** folder. Copy the file over to your application for use.

  You can find a video tutorial showing how to use this application on my [youtube](https://youtu.be/xDJVrMvxXvg) channel!

  ## Contributing

  The [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) npm package was used to create the interactive command line user interface.
